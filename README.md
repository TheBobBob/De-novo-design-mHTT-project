Associated publication: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10739680

.SDF files are the structure files for the small molecules created in the study. The name of the SDF file corresponds with the residue on the Rhes (ras homolog enriched in striatum) protein. The PDB file is the structure file for the docked mHTT (mutant huntingtin) and Rhes protein structure.
